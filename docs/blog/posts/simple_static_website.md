# simple static website
If you want to create a simple static website on GitHub, you can explore the following options:

<!-- more -->

## MkDocs
MkDocs is a simple yet powerful static site generator written in Python. It allows you to create advanced static sites by preparing your documentation in standard Markdown format and feeding it into MkDocs.

For theming for software,  you can use a simple theme like the [MkDocs Bootswatch Themes](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs-bootswatch). To get started with installation, follow the [installation](https://mkdocs.github.io/mkdocs-bootswatch/) here.

## orderedlist
The [orderedlist minimal](https://orderedlist.com/minimal/) for GitHub Pages is built using HTML, and you can customize it with basic HTML knowledge. You can create your own copy and modify the [index.html] file to suit your needs. An example of a site using this theme can be found at [DS-python-data-analysis](https://jorisvandenbossche.github.io/DS-python-data-analysis/).
