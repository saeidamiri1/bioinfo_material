# Login Issues
If you're unable to log in to [DRAC](https://www.alliancecan.ca/en) or if it gets stuck after entering your credentials, first check the [status page](https://status.alliancecan.ca/) for any reported incidents. If none are reported, the issue may be due to system slowness, which DRAC may be able to resolve. If you are still in the terminal, press Ctrl+C to interrupt, then try logging in again and performing basic operations, as the system may be slow.
